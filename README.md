*(Note: Username was obscured, will show relevant info to signed-in account in actuality)*

## To-Do (Low priority improvements):
- Remove ability to see all other userbase (Possibly via a friending system)
- Add ability to pick your own user-side name
- Add more login options (Plain email/password)
- Add message deletion on user side (Rather than entire chat)
